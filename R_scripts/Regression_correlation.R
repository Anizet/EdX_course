#The correlation coefficient is defined for a list of pairs  (x1,y1),...,(xn,yn)  as the product of the standardized values:  (xi−μxσx)(yi−μyσy) .

#Conditioning on a random variable X can help to reduce variance of response variable Y.
#The standard deviation of the conditional distribution is  SD(Y∣X=x)=σy1−ρ2−−−−−√ , which is smaller than the standard deviation without conditioning  σy .
#Because variance is the standard deviation squared, the variance of the conditional distribution is  σ2y(1−ρ2) .
#In the statement "X explains such and such percent of the variability," the percent value refers to the variance. The variance decreases by  ρ2  percent.
#The “variance explained” statement only makes sense when the data is approximated by a bivariate normal distribution.
